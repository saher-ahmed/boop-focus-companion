# Boop

A tiny Chrome extension that helps you stay on task — especially if your brain likes to wander.

Boop is a focus companion built for people who drift between tabs. Tell it what you're working on, and it quietly watches your back. If you drift to another site, it gives you a gentle nudge to come back. No shame, no stress — just a little boop.

## How it works

1. **Set a task** — type what you're working on and the site you should be on (e.g. `notion.so`)
2. **Boop remembers your site** — it monitors which tab you're actually in
3. **Drift somewhere else?** — after 2 minutes, Boop nudges you back with a notification and flips the pill from green to amber
4. **Park tasks** — need to context-switch? Park your current task and come back to it later without losing your place
